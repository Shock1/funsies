    <p><b>Romance:</b> 
      <br><br> Both pumpkin and banana say "I love you" at the end of every call or prior to departure from a lover.
      <br><br> A 4-second kiss given if the leave is for more than a few hours long.
      <br><br> Hearts need a date one day a week to keep love at its peak.
      <br><br> Communication remains free of jokes or mentions of divorce for a positive outlook on the future.
      <br><br> Pumpkin may dress as she wishes, if safety is assured by banana or her besties.
      </p>


    <br><br><p><b>Family:</b>
      <br><br> Bed with comfort need no phones within reach, as the night is reserved for joyful rest.
      <br><br> Even in the heat of disagreement, no cursing and no name-calling to respect and understand.
      <br><br> Conflict disagreements are kept private, away from children, relatives, and the public.
      <br><br> Teach financial literacy to all family members, including children from an early age.
      <br><br> Banana is a storyteller when children are going to bed.
      <br><br> Household chores are a shared responsibility between pumpkin and banana.
      </p>
